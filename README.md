# Summary
- Conversion Rate: The conversion rate varies throughout the year with in general is quite consistent with higher number of products converting in Jan, July,..etc.., with the strongest converting comes from Jan, this may indicates a seasonal demand
- Customer: The views are unstable, with peaked at the start of years and have seen a declined since Jun, clicks and likes are low compared to views. This suggests we need more diverse content and engagement.
